FormReminder Frontend Development Report
=======================================



Overview
--------
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the frontend development work completed for the FormReminder application. The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Ant Design, with a focus on modern UI/UX, robust authentication, and seamless integration with backend services. Below, we detail each major area of functionality, user experience, and technical implementation.

1. Authentication & User Management
-----------------------------------
- **Login, Registration, and Password Management:**
  - Developed dedicated pages for user login, registration, forgot password, and password reset, ensuring a smooth onboarding and account recovery process.
  - Implemented a reusable `AuthForm` component that dynamically adapts to login, registration, and password reset modes, providing consistent validation and user feedback.
  - Integrated OAuth/token-based authentication via an `AuthCallback` page, handling secure token exchange and storage.
  - Built-in token management: the app automatically checks token validity, handles expiration, and securely logs out users when necessary.
  - Protected routes: Only authenticated users can access main app features, with automatic redirection to login if not authenticated.

2. Navigation & Application Layout
----------------------------------
- **Sidebar Navigation:**
  - Created a visually appealing and intuitive sidebar for primary navigation, allowing users to quickly access Form Requests, New Request creation, and Settings.
  - Sidebar highlights the current section and uses clear icons for usability.
- **Header Bar:**
  - Developed a header bar for secondary navigation and user actions, ensuring a cohesive layout across all pages.
- **Routing:**
  - Utilized React Router for client-side navigation, with a clear separation between public (auth) and protected (app) routes.
  - All main features are accessible via clean, user-friendly URLs.

3. Form Requests Management
---------------------------
- **Form Requests Dashboard:**
  - Implemented the `FormRequestsPage` to display all form requests associated with the user/organization.
  - Data is fetched securely from the backend and presented in a sortable, interactive table.
  - Users can click on any request to view its details (via `FormRequestDetailPage`).
- **Create New Form Request:**
  - Developed a comprehensive `NewRequestPage` for creating new form requests, featuring:
    - Input fields for request title and form URL.
    - Google Sheet integration for submission tracking, including:
      - Guided steps for linking a Google Form to a Sheet.
      - UI for entering and verifying the Sheet URL and email column.
      - Instructions and tooltips to assist users in sharing the Sheet with the app.
    - Recipient upload: Users can paste tab-separated recipient data, with real-time validation for format and email correctness.
    - Reminder schedule selection: Users can choose from predefined reminder schedules (Gentle, Normal, Frequent).
    - Seamless multi-step form experience with clear error handling and success feedback.
  - Upon submission, the app creates the form request and uploads recipients to the backend, with robust error handling and user notifications.
- **Form Request Details:**
  - `FormRequestDetailPage` is structured to display detailed information about a specific form request, supporting future enhancements for analytics and management.

4. User Settings & Preferences
-----------------------------
- **Settings Page:**
  - Built a modern, user-friendly `SettingsPage` for managing account and organization preferences.
  - Editable fields for user email, password, organization name, subscription, preferred reminder time, and timezone.
  - Inline editing with save/cancel actions for a smooth user experience.
  - Password change workflow with secure input handling.
  - Designed for extensibility to support additional settings in the future.

5. UI/UX & Technical Implementation
-----------------------------------
- **Design System:**
  - Leveraged Ant Design (antd) for a consistent, professional look and feel across all components.
  - Used Tailwind CSS for custom styling and responsive layouts.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Integrated `react-toastify` for toast notifications, providing instant feedback on actions (success, error, info).
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:**
  - All pages are responsive and accessible, ensuring usability across devices and for all users.
- **Code Quality:**
  - TypeScript is used throughout for type safety and maintainability.
  - ESLint and best practices are followed for code quality and consistency.

6. Additional Features & Notes
------------------------------
- **Asset Management:**
  - Static assets and icons are organized for easy maintenance and future expansion.
- **Extensible Architecture:**
  - The frontend is structured for scalability, allowing for easy addition of new features and pages.
- **Integration Ready:**
  - All API calls are modular and ready for integration with the backend, supporting secure token-based communication.

Conclusion
